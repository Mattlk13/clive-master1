- **Name:** The Haskell Lightweight Virtual Machine (HaLVM)
- **Description:** The Haskell Lightweight Virtual Machine (HaLVM) is a port of
  the Glasgow Haskell Compiler toolsuite that enables developers to write
  high-level, lightweight virtual machines that can run directly on the Xen
  hypervisor. While Galois initially designed the HaLVM to allow for quick and
  easy prototyping of operating systems components, it has grown over time to
  allow for a much wider variety of use cases. When connected with the
  appopriate libraries, the HaLVM can, for example, operate as a network appliance.
