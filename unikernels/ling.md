- **Name:** LING (aka Erlang on Xen)
- **Description:** LING is an Erlang unikernel runtime. It is more or less compatible
  with BEAM (see the compatibility link below) and almost as performant, but it's
  main feature is that it runs directly against Xen's paravirtualized drivers and
  allows you to run standard Erlang/OTP code as a unikernel directly against a
  hypervisor such as Xen or a public cloud such as Amazon's EC2.
