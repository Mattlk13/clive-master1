- **Name:** OSv
- **Description:** OSv is a new open-source operating system for virtual 
  machines. OSv was designed from the ground up to execute a single application
  on top of a hypervisor, resulting in superior performance and effortless
  management when compared to traditional operating systems which were designed
  for a vast range of physical machines. OSv has new APIs for new applications,
  but also runs unmodified Linux applications (most of Linux's ABI is supported)
  and in particular can run an unmodified JVM, and applications built on top of one.
