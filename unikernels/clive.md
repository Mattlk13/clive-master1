- **Name:** Clive
- **Description:** Clive is a research project that takes a modified Go compiler
  and couples it with a runtime kernel that will allow the final artifact to be
  run against a hypervisor or bare metal blade. This is still certainly a research
  project, but it is a very, very interesting project.
